node-bmw
======
A node.js powered interface for IBUS BMW vehicles, for use with Raspberry Pi.

Currently being developed using a US-spec 2000 E39 540i and a Raspberry Pi 3.

I'll add more to this once I'm out of the dirty-dev weeds.

I used [@osvathrobi](https://github.com/osvathrobi)'s [node-ibus](https://github.com/osvathrobi/node-ibus) project as a launchpad for this. He already had the serial interface going, among other things. I learn better when I take something apart, anyways.
